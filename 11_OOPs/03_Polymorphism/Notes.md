### **Polymorphism in Python:**

Polymorphism is one of the fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). The word "Polymorphism" is derived from Greek, which means "many shapes." In programming, polymorphism allows us to define methods in the child class with the same name as those in the parent class, but with different behavior. 

Polymorphism is primarily used in **inheritance** and **overloading**. It provides the ability to use a method from a class without knowing exactly which object type the method will be executed on.

### **Types of Polymorphism:**

1. **Method Overloading**: 
   - This occurs when two or more methods in the same class have the same name but different arguments. Python does not support method overloading directly, but we can simulate it by using default arguments or variable-length arguments.

2. **Method Overriding**: 
   - This happens when a method in a child class has the same name and parameters as a method in the parent class, but the child class method has a different implementation. The child class method "overrides" the parent class method.

3. **Operator Overloading**: 
   - This allows custom behavior for operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, etc., for user-defined objects.

### **1. Method Overloading:**

In Python, we cannot overload methods in the way we can in languages like Java or C++. However, we can simulate method overloading by using default parameters or *args/**kwargs to handle different numbers of arguments.

#### **Example: Method Overloading Simulation**
```python
class A:
    # Method with no arguments
    def truck(self):
        print("Empty truck is running.")

    # Method with one argument
    def truck(self, n=None):
        if n is None:
            print("Empty truck is running.")
        else:
            print(f"Truck is running with {n} tons of load.")
            
# Create object of class A
o1 = A()

# Calling truck method with different number of arguments
o1.truck()   # Will call the first method
o1.truck(30) # Will call the second method
```

#### **Explanation:**
- **Method Overloading** occurs when we define multiple methods with the same name but different arguments.
- In the above code, we simulate method overloading by checking if the argument `n` is `None`. This way, we can create multiple behaviors for the same method name, depending on the argument passed.

### **2. Method Overriding:**

Method overriding is the process by which a child class provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class. This allows the child class to modify the behavior of the inherited method.

#### **Example: Method Overriding**
```python
class India:
    def person(self):
        print("Myself Utkarsh.")
        print("I am Indian.")
        print("I am wearing dhoti and khadi.")

class Canada(India):
    # Overriding the person method
    def person(self):
        print("Myself Utkarsh.")
        print("I am Canadian.")
        print("I am wearing jeans and a T-shirt.")

# Create object of India class
o1 = India()  
o1.person()  # Calls method from parent class (India)

# Create object of Canada class
o2 = Canada()
o2.person()  # Calls overridden method from child class (Canada)
```

#### **Explanation:**
- In the above example, the `Canada` class **overrides** the `person()` method that was defined in the `India` class. 
- When we create an object of the `Canada` class and call `person()`, the method from the child class is called instead of the method from the parent class, demonstrating **method overriding**.

### **3. Operator Overloading:**

In Python, we can define special methods to change the behavior of standard operators (like `+`, `-`, `*`, etc.) for user-defined classes. This is called **operator overloading**.

#### **Example: Operator Overloading**
```python
class Complex:
    def __init__(self, n1, n2):
        self.x = n1
        self.y = n2

    # Overloading the + operator for complex numbers
    def __add__(self, other):
        p = self.x + other.x
        q = self.y + other.y
        return Complex(p, q)

    def getData(self):
        print(f"x = {self.x} & y = {self.y}")

# Create complex number objects
c1 = Complex(5, 3)
c2 = Complex(1, 6)

c1.getData()
c2.getData()

# Use overloaded + operator
c3 = c1 + c2  # Adding complex numbers using overloaded + operator
c3.getData()
```

#### **Explanation:**
- In the above example, we overload the `+` operator for the `Complex` class by defining the `__add__` method. This allows us to add two complex numbers using the `+` operator, which otherwise wouldn't work for user-defined objects.
- The `getData()` method is used to display the values of the complex numbers.

### **Note:**

1. **Polymorphism** allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common super type. It is the ability to use a method in different ways based on the class type of the object.
   
2. **Method Overloading** refers to the ability to define multiple methods with the same name but different parameters (arguments). In Python, we simulate this using default arguments or variable-length arguments.

3. **Method Overriding** allows a child class to provide its own implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class.

4. **Operator Overloading** is used to define the behavior of standard operators (like `+`, `-`, etc.) for user-defined classes.

Polymorphism is a key concept in object-oriented programming that allows methods and operators to be used in multiple ways. By using polymorphism, we can make our code more flexible, reusable, and maintainable. In Python, method overloading, method overriding, and operator overloading provide powerful ways to work with polymorphic behavior in classes.
