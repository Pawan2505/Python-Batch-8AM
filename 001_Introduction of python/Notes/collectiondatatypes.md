### **1. `list`**
- **Purpose**: An ordered, mutable collection that can store items of any type.
- **Example**: `my_list = [1, 2, 3]`
- **Comment**: Lists are flexible and allow modification (add, remove, or change elements) after creation.

---

### **2. `set`**
- **Purpose**: An unordered collection of unique elements.
- **Example**: `my_set = {1, 2, 3}`
- **Comment**: Sets automatically remove duplicate items and do not preserve the order of elements.

---

### **3. `tuple`**
- **Purpose**: An ordered, immutable collection that can store items of any type.
- **Example**: `my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)`
- **Comment**: Tuples are similar to lists, but their values cannot be modified after creation (immutable).

---

### **4. `frozenset`**
- **Purpose**: An immutable version of a set.
- **Example**: `my_frozenset = frozenset([1, 2, 3])`
- **Comment**: Frozensets have all the properties of sets but cannot be changed (no adding/removing elements).

---

### **5. `dict`**
- **Purpose**: A collection of key-value pairs, also known as a mapping.
- **Example**: `my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}`
- **Comment**: Dictionaries store data in a key-value format and allow fast lookups based on keys. Keys must be unique.
