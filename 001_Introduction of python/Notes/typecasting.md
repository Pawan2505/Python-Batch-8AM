### **1. `int()`**
- **Purpose**: Converts a value into an integer.
- **Example**: `int("42")` → `42`
- **Comment**: Useful for converting string representations of numbers into integers.

### **2. `float()`**
- **Purpose**: Converts a value into a floating-point number.
- **Example**: `float("12.5")` → `12.5`
- **Comment**: Used when you need to convert a string or integer to a decimal number.

### **4. `ord()`**
- **Purpose**: Returns the Unicode code point of a character (integer).
- **Example**: `ord('A')` → `65`
- **Comment**: Used to get the integer representation of a character in the Unicode standard.

---

### **5. `char()`**
- **Note**: Python doesn't have a built-in `char()` function.  
  Instead, you can use `chr()` to get the character for a given integer (Unicode code point).
- **Purpose**: Converts an integer (Unicode code point) to its corresponding character.
- **Example**: `chr(65)` → `'A'`
- **Comment**: Converts a Unicode code point back to the character it represents.

---

### **6. `bin()`**
- **Purpose**: Converts an integer to its binary representation (as a string).
- **Example**: `bin(10)` → `'0b1010'`
- **Comment**: Useful for working with binary values and bit manipulation.

---

### **7. `hex()`**
- **Purpose**: Converts an integer to its hexadecimal representation (as a string).
- **Example**: `hex(255)` → `'0xff'`
- **Comment**: Helpful for representing numbers in hexadecimal format, often used in color codes and memory addresses.

---

### **8. `oct()`**
- **Purpose**: Converts an integer to its octal representation (as a string).
- **Example**: `oct(8)` → `'0o10'`
- **Comment**: Used for working with octal numbers, often in legacy systems or file permissions.

---

### **9. `complex()`**
- **Purpose**: Creates a complex number with a real and imaginary part.
- **Example**: `complex(2, 3)` → `(2+3j)`
- **Comment**: Represents complex numbers, which have a real part and an imaginary part.
