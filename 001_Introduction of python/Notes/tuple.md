### **Tuple in Python**
A **tuple** in Python is an **ordered, immutable** collection of elements. Unlike lists, tuples **cannot be modified** after creation, making them useful for storing fixed data.

#### **Syntax:**
```python
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
```

### **Key Characteristics of Tuples:**
- **Immutable** – Once created, elements cannot be changed.
- **Ordered** – The order of elements is preserved.
- **Allows Duplicates** – A tuple can contain duplicate values.
- **Can Contain Multiple Data Types** – Strings, integers, lists, etc.

## **Tuple Methods**
Since tuples are immutable, they have only a few built-in methods:

### **1. `count()`**
Counts the number of times a specified element appears in a tuple.
```python
t = (1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5)
print(t.count(1))  # Output: 3
```

### **2. `index()`**
Finds the index of the first occurrence of a specified value.
```python
t = (10, 20, 30, 40, 20)
print(t.index(20))  # Output: 1 (first occurrence)
```

## **Tuple Operations**
Even though tuples are immutable, we can perform various operations:

### **1. Tuple Concatenation (`+`)**
Joins two or more tuples.
```python
t1 = (1, 2, 3)
t2 = (4, 5, 6)
result = t1 + t2
print(result)  # Output: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
```

### **2. Tuple Repetition (`*`)**
Repeats the elements of a tuple.
```python
t = (1, 2, 3)
print(t * 3)  # Output: (1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3)
```

### **3. Membership Testing (`in`)**
Checks if an element exists in a tuple.
```python
t = ('apple', 'banana', 'cherry')
print('banana' in t)  # Output: True
```

### **4. Tuple Slicing**
Extracts parts of a tuple.
```python
t = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50)
print(t[1:4])  # Output: (20, 30, 40)
```

### **5. Tuple Unpacking**
Assigns tuple elements to multiple variables.
```python
t = (10, 20, 30)
a, b, c = t
print(a, b, c)  # Output: 10 20 30
```

## **When to Use Tuples?**
- When you want **immutable** data (e.g., storing constant values).
- When you need **faster performance** (tuples are faster than lists).
- When working with **dictionary keys** (since tuples are hashable).
